This website connects to the MapQuest Open Directions API by building a URL 
with the user inputted locations and making an HTTP request. It retrieves the parsed JSON result from this request, 
and displays the directions, total distance, total time, and the latidude and longitude of each location
by crawling through the information from the JSON result.

The website was created by utilizing the Django web framework.
